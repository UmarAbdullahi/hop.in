# HOP.In - An app like Uber, but worse.

### Open it in Expo Go: https://expo.dev/@georrgecb/hop-in

#### (Soon to be published on Google Play)

### Why worse?

#### Probably because Uber has more than one developer.

### But it's still a good app, right?

#### Yes, maybe, I don't know. It took me more than a week to build this wonderful app, my first app ever, and I'm kinda proud of it.

### Three different APIs

#### It would have been way easier with Google Places API, but I'm not ready yet to put my credit card info on their platform. Using other (free) maps and location APIs isn't fun, but during this process, I did learn a lot.

### Tailwind > Bootstrap

#### Before developing this app, I wasn't familiar with Tailwind. Now I'm a big fan of it.

### Conclusions

#### This was by far the most elaborate project I have ever worked on and also the most challenging and fun and mind-opening. This is just one of many apps that I'm planning to develop in order to become a better front-end developer, so stay tuned and maybe contact me on LinkedIn, idk. I'm open for work, just saying.
